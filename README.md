## Notes

To make the app, it was pretty straight forward if you follow the above video. Although I did have some trouble with anchoring elements on the screen to where they should be, however, I figured it out along the way. My main issue was figuring out git, which was a hassle. Word of advice, just use the token system that Android Studio offers. Other than that, it was a great project and I recommend following the above video if you're interested in trying it out for yourself.
